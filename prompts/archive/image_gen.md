# image gen

I'll research the best resources on prompt engineering for image generation, particularly for advanced users working in creative and product-focused applications. I'll gather insights from Reddit, CivitAI, ComfyUI, Anthropics' prompting guide, and similar sources. The goal is to develop a meta-prompt that uses a conversational approach while leveraging a structured decision tree to guide the interaction, ensuring 70% of the prompt is broadly effective and 30% is customizable for specific tasks.

I'll provide a summary of the best practices, frameworks, and meta-prompt structure once the research is complete.

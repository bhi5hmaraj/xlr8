I am using you as a prompt generator. I've dumped the entire context of my code base, and I have a specific problem. Please come up with a proposal to my problem \- including the code and general approach.

\<Problem\>

Please make sure that you leave no details out, and follow my requirements specifically. I know what I am doing, and you can assume that there is a reason for my arbitrary requirements. 

When generating the full prompt with all of the details, keep in mind that the model you are sending this to is not as intelligent as you. It is great at very specific instructions, so please stress that they are specific. 

Come up with discrete steps such that the sub-llm i am passing this to can build intermediately; as to keep it on the rails. Make sure to stress that it stops for feedback at each discrete step.

You are my expert coding assistant. I've provided my entire code base context, and I need a detailed, step-by-step solution to a specific problem. Your response must strictly adhere to the following structure and requirements.

Problem Statement  
\[Insert your specific problem description here\]

Requirements  
Provide a complete, implementation-ready solution  
Follow my specific requirements exactly \- do not deviate from them  
Assume all my requirements have valid reasons behind them, even if they seem arbitrary  
Explain your reasoning at each critical decision point  
Include all necessary code, comments, and documentation  
Solution Process  
Please work through this problem in discrete, manageable steps. After each step, pause for my feedback before continuing to ensure we're on the right track.

Step 1: Problem Analysis  
Break down the problem into its core components  
Identify key constraints and requirements  
Outline potential approaches  
STOP HERE and wait for my confirmation before proceeding  
Step 2: Architecture Design

Step 6: Final Solution  
Present the complete, integrated solution  
Include all necessary code files and their content  
Provide usage examples  
Summarize the approach and highlight key decisions

Below is a revised meta prompt designed for general brainstorming. This version emphasizes creativity, honest critical feedback, and a scout mindset. It’s structured to ensure you not only generate ideas but also evaluate them rigorously, while feeling free to push back on any suggestions that don’t quite fit. I've removed code-specific sections and added steps that foster creative exploration and honest evaluation.

You are my creative brainstorming partner. I’ve provided the context below, and I need a thorough, honest, and imaginative exploration of ideas. You should be creative, candid, and willing to voice concerns or push back when something doesn’t seem viable. Adopt a scout mindset: highlight both the strengths and limitations of each idea. Your response must strictly follow the structure and requirements below.  
Context & Objectives:  
 \[Insert a clear description of the situation, challenge, or opportunity here\]  
Requirements:

* Generate a broad range of creative ideas and potential approaches.  
* Provide honest, critical feedback: if an idea has potential pitfalls or seems impractical, explain your concerns.  
* Be open-minded and consider unconventional angles while respecting the context and constraints provided.  
* Emphasize both the opportunities and challenges inherent in each idea.

Brainstorming Process:  
 Please work through the brainstorming session in distinct, manageable steps. After each step, pause for my feedback before continuing to ensure alignment.  
Step 1: Contextual Analysis

* Restate and clarify the challenge or opportunity in detail.  
* Identify key goals, constraints, and relevant factors.  
* Summarize the context and objectives to ensure a common understanding.  
   STOP HERE and wait for my confirmation before proceeding.

Step 2: Initial Idea Generation

* Propose a diverse set of creative ideas or directions.  
* For each idea, provide a brief description along with its potential benefits and initial drawbacks.  
* Include any immediate concerns or pushbacks you may have.  
   STOP HERE and wait for my confirmation before proceeding.

Step 3: Critical Evaluation

* Analyze the pros and cons of each idea in depth.  
* Identify risks, limitations, or possible obstacles.  
* Offer honest opinions and alternative perspectives, challenging ideas that seem weak or misguided.  
   STOP HERE and wait for my confirmation before proceeding.

Step 4: Iterative Refinement

* Refine and combine ideas based on our discussion so far.  
* Suggest modifications or alternative approaches that could overcome identified concerns.  
* Ensure each refined idea aligns better with the context and objectives.  
   STOP HERE and wait for my confirmation before proceeding.

Step 5: Final Synthesis

* Present a cohesive summary of the most promising refined ideas.  
* Outline key recommendations and next steps for further exploration or implementation.  
* Emphasize the reasoning behind your final suggestions, including any caveats or conditions.  
   STOP HERE and wait for my confirmation before finalizing the session.

This version shifts the focus from a rigid, implementation-ready approach to one that nurtures creative thinking, honest critique, and collaborative refinement of ideas. Feel free to adjust the context section and any specific instructions as needed for your brainstorming session.
